## Theme Setup
This vault initially uses the **Minimal Theme**. For easier customization of the theme, the community plugin **Minimal Theme Settings** is installed. Using this plugin, the **Light mode color scheme** and the **Dark mode color scheme** settings are both set to **macOS**.

These setting can be altered to suit your needs.

## Custom CSS for Properties
The "Add Property" command can only be disabled globally using the Style Settings plugin. To hide the command in reading mode, a custom CSS has to be created as described in this [Obsidian forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-show-properties-and-add-property-button-in-reading-mode/66209)

This vault therefore contains the CSS **Histovault.css** in the snippets directory. Additionally, the properties title is hidden using the Style Settings plugin. The display of properties can be toggled using the command "Toggle fold properties in the current file" that is also configured in the menubar .
