The **Arab League** is a regional organization in the Arab world. The league was formed in [[Cairo]] on March 22, 1945.

The League's main goal is to "draw **closer the relations** between member states and **co-ordinate collaboration** between them, to **safeguard their independence and sovereignty**, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries"
