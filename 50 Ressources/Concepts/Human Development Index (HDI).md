The **Human Development Index (HDI)** is a statistical tool developed by the [[United Nations]] to measure the social and economic development of countries. It combines several dimensions of human development:

1. **Life Expectancy at Birth:**
   - An indicator of the health and longevity of the population.

2. **Education:**
   - Measured by the average number of years of schooling completed by people aged 25 and older, and the expected number of years of schooling a child of school entry age will complete.

3. **Income Level:**
   - Measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).

The HDI is an attempt to provide a broader view of development, going beyond GDP to include health, education, and income as key components of human well-being and capabilities. Countries are classified into categories from "very high human development" to "low human development" based on their HDI value.
