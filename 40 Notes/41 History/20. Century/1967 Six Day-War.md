The **Six Day-War** was fought between [[Israel]] and a coalition of Arab states ([[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]]) from 5 to 10 June 1967.

The war began on June 5, 1967, when Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, fearing an imminent attack. Israel quickly defeated the Egyptian air force and then turned its attention to Jordan and Syria.

The war ended on June 10, 1967, with a ceasefire. Israel had made significant territorial gains, capturing the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] from Egypt, the [[West Bank]] (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, and the [[Golan Heights]] from Syria.
